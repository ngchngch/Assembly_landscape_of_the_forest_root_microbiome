# Assembly_landscape_of_the_forest_root_microbiome
In this repository, we showed "assembly landscape" concept and algorisms of keystone inference based on it.

# Relationship between clasical stability landscape and empirically reconstructed assembly landscapes
The stability landscape concept illustrates the relationship between community structure and stability (left), whereas assembly landscapes, inferred from empirical data, describe the statistical relationship between community states and their probabilities of observation (right). Both convergence toward true attractors and prolonged transients around a “ghost attractor” on a conceptual stability landscape can result in clusters of observations in empirical datasets. In statistical analyses of assembly landscapes, assembly toward true attractors is represented by deep basins, while long transients around ghost attractors can be inferred as shallow basins. Assembly landscapes estimated by the statistical framework of energy landscape analysis (described below) are referred to as energy landscapes.
